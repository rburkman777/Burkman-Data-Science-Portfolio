# Burkman-Data-Science-Portfolio

## Overview

This respository will contain several projects that will demonstrate my skills across a vareity of platforms. They will also highlight my talents for data analysis, coding, and visualizing my findings. 

My first project is underway and is now avaiable in this repository. It allows the user to explore data about congressional distircts from the 2022 election. You can view it in the basic_streamlit_app1 folder.

## How to Load the App via Visual Studio Code

In order to run the app yourself, simply open up a python script in visual studio code. Paste the code in the "main.py" file into a new file. Go to the terminal (you can activate the terminal by pressing the third "button" from the bottom right with circle and a triangle). Once you have the terminal open, type "streamlit run (whatever you named the file).py into the interface and hit enter. It should take you to the application. If that does not work, copy the second link that gets produced into the interface and paste it into a different browser than the one the application originally tried to open on. You will also want to take the data from the data folder and load it into Visual Studio. The raw data and CSV data is provided in the data folder. There is also a copy in the basic_streamlit_app1 folder outside the data folder.
