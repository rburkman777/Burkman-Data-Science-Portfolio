# Burkman-Data-Science-Portfolio
This respository will contain several projects that will demonstrate my skills across a vareity of platforms. They will also highlight my talents for data analysis, coding, and visualizing my findings. 

In the future, I will have a folder for brief, concise information about each model as well as a folder for more detailed and technical description of works. Both folders will contain a visualization of the respective model. Both folders will be avaiable in this repository and will be linked to my main page as well.
