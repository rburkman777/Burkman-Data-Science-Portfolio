# Burkman-Data-Science-Portfolio
This respository contains several projects that I have worked on that I believe demonstrate my skills and abilities across the platforms I am versed in and the research skills they demonstrate. 

In the future, I will have a folder for brief, concise information about each model as well as a folder for more detailed and technical description of works. Both folders will be avaiable in this repository and will be linked to my main page as well.
