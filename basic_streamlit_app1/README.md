The Streamlit app is an open source Python framework for data scientists to deliver interactive data applications. 
In order to use the app, simply open up a python script in visual studio code. Paste the code in the "main.py" file into a new file. Go to the terminal (you can activate the terminal by pressing the third "button" from the bottom right with circle and a triangle). Once you have the terminal open, type "streamlit run (whatever you named the file).py into the interface and hit enter. It should take you to the application. If that does not work, copy the second link that gets produced into the interface and paste it into a different browser than the one the application originally tried to open on. 
While exploring the app, do notice the data has been displayed for easy viewing. You can sort the data
