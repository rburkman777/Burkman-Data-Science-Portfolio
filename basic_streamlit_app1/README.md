## Overview

The Streamlit app is an open source Python framework for data scientists to deliver interactive data applications.

## How to Load the App via Visual Studio Code

In order to run the app yourself, simply open up a python script in visual studio code. Paste the code in the "main.py" file into a new file. Go to the terminal (you can activate the terminal by pressing the third "button" from the bottom right with circle and a triangle). Once you have the terminal open, type "streamlit run (whatever you named the file).py into the interface and hit enter. It should take you to the application. If that does not work, copy the second link that gets produced into the interface and paste it into a different browser than the one the application originally tried to open on. You will also want to take the data from the data folder and load it into Visual Studio. The raw data and CSV data is provided in the data folder. There is also a copy in the basic_streamlit_app1 folder outside the data folder. 

## App Description

The app lets you explore congressional election information compiled by FiveThirtyEight in the leadup to the 2022 election. The data is partially based on real electino results. While exploring the app, do notice the data has been displayed for easy viewing. You can sort the congressional distircts by "partisan voting index" (aka PVI) and by their level of density as categorized by state. From this, you can find information on the voting habits of different states and the trends across congressional districts. 

## Commit history

To see the commit history of the file of the app's code, you may have to click through some old renames before it comes up.

## Important Note

I want to acknowledge that I used AI to help me write the code for the slider and the bar graph as I did not know how to write it myself yet. I studied the code it produced to get an understanding of it. The rest of the code was written either cold turkey or using in-class examples.
